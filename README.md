# 2020 CDC Project Submission Template

This repository is a private space for you and your team to collaborate with one another. The datasets for each track are available in [this repository](https://github.com/Carolina-Data-Challenge/datasets) for ease of access. While we can only encourage you to work out of this repository throughout the event, do note that **you will be required to submit your project files in this repository for judging**.

Specifically, to submit your project you will be required to complete the following:
- Upload all code and related project files that you would like to be considered during judging to this repository no later than Sunday (10/4) at 11:00AM EST.
- Record and upload a 5 minute video of your team's presentation to your video platform of choice. Paste the **public link** for you video in this file (in the marked location) no later than Sunday (10/4) at 11:59AM EST.
- Navigate to your team's management page in the portal. Once there, indicate that you have successfully submitted your project on time and select which sponsor prize category you would like your project to be considered for (if any).
